# TUI-for-Docker
Many people hate installing apps on the host OS and files getting everywhere. Running the GUI applications increases the CPU/RAM consumption like we all know how the hungry google chrome eats a lot of RAM and CPU. The TUI(terminal User Interface) for Docker is an attempt to create a program that manages creation and deletetion of containers based GUI applications. By this approach we can solve the issues like when we face when we delete an app but still some of its files remain somewhere hidden, System processing will be enhanced as the GUI's would be contained and isolated!!
